# Practice 4 — Python Advanced Topics

This repository contains solutions for Practice 4, which focuses on advanced Python
topics including generators, working with dates and time, mathematical operations,
and JSON data handling.

The goal of this practice is to understand how Python works with iteration, standard
library modules, and structured data formats.

## 🔹 Generators

The `generators.py` file demonstrates:
- generator functions using `yield`
- generating values one by one
- memory-efficient iteration
- simple generator-based tasks

Generators allow producing sequences without storing all values in memory at once.

---

## 🔹 Dates and Time

The `dates.py` file covers:
- working with the `datetime` module
- getting the current date and time
- formatting dates using `strftime`
- parsing strings into datetime objects
- date arithmetic using `timedelta`

---

## 🔹 Math Operations

The `math.py` file demonstrates:
- built-in math functions (`min`, `max`, `abs`, `pow`)
- usage of the `math` module
- square roots, rounding functions, and constants like `pi`

---

## 🔹 JSON Handling

The `json_examples.py` file demonstrates:
- parsing JSON strings using `json.loads`
- converting Python objects to JSON using `json.dumps`
- writing JSON data to files
- reading JSON data from files

These examples show how Python works with structured data commonly used in APIs.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Practice

The purpose of Practice 4 is to:
- understand generators and lazy evaluation
- work with dates and time correctly
- use Python standard library modules
- handle JSON data in Python programs

All examples are written in a simple and readable form for educational purposes.

## ▶️ How to Run

To run any file, use:

```bash
python filename.py
Examples:

python generators.py
python dates.py
python math.py
python json_examples.py
✅ Notes
Each file contains independent examples.

No external libraries are required.

The code is intended for learning and practice.
